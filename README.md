Detailed Explanation
Booking and ERP Integration

When a guest books a room via Booking, their phone number is sent to the hotel's ERP system.
The ERP system generates a door code for the guest and sends it in an email to the hotel's designated email address.
Email Retrieval

The bot connects to the hotel's email inbox using the IMAP protocol.
It searches for emails from the ERP system containing door codes.
Email Parsing

The bot fetches the latest email from the ERP system.
It parses the email to extract the door code and the guest's phone number.
Sending Door Code via Telegram

The bot formats the phone number if necessary (ensuring it includes the country code).
It sends the extracted door code to the guest's phone number using the Telegram Bot API.
Example
Hereâ€™s an example configuration for the .env file:


IMAP_SERVER=imap.gmail.com
IMAP_USER=hotelbooking@example.com
IMAP_PASS=mysecurepassword
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=123456789:ABCdefGhijKlmNoPQrstUVwxyz1234567890


Run the bot with:

python bot.py

This will start the bot, which will periodically check for new emails from the ERP system and send the door codes to guests via Telegram.
